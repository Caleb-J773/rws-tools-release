# RWS-Tools: A Collection of *eventual* Utilities for Radio Web Services RWS
Welcome to RWS-Tools, a fun and experimental project for expanding Radio Web Services (RWS) through the development of tools and applications. My well goal is to inspire and provide resources for the community.

## About RWS-Tools 
RWS-Tools will be an open-source collection of Python scripts and applications that I'm working on alongside my AI helper to enhance and extend Radio Web Services. The project is led by me! A RWS user with a interest for learning and experimenting. While I am not an expert Python programmer (like at all lol), I am committed to understanding the fundamentals of programming and AI through hands-on experience. As such, as part of my own research into AI's and such. This project is being led with Code AI's, to see how effective they are. I am not good with creating a base, but I understand the code! So expect sloppy code or other wackiness. This is also a project for me to see how Code AI's are, both local models ran on my machine or in the cloud.
