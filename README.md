# RWS-Tools: A Collection of *eventual* Utilities for Radio Web Services RWS
Welcome to RWS-Tools, a fun and experimental project for expanding Radio Web Services (RWS) through the development of tools and applications. My well goal is to inspire and provide resources for the community.
These tools are of course, mainly just user side, nothing host related, at least I don't think yet. I don't do Java heh.

## About RWS-Tools 
RWS-Tools will be an open-source collection of Python scripts and applications that I'm working on alongside my AI helper to enhance and extend Radio Web Services. The project is led by me! A RWS user with a interest for learning and experimenting. While I am not an expert 
Python programmer (like at all lol). 

I am committed to understanding the fundamentals of programming and AI through hands-on experience. As such, as part of my own research into AI's and such. This project is being led with Code AI's, to see how effective they are. I am not good with creating a base, but I understand the code! So expect sloppy code or other wackiness. Again, this is a project for me as well to see how Code AI's are, both local models ran on my machine or in the cloud. It's very interesting. 

See the releases tab for current released complied versions of scripts/applications. Or checkout the experiements section. I'm working on some random stuff or trying different stuff.
